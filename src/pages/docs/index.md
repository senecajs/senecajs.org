# Documentation
Seneca tutorials offer a deep dive into a particular concept or feature. We also have a number of sample projects, small and large
that demonstrate how to use Seneca in a number of different ways and with different complimentary technologies.

## Tutorials

- [Logging with Seneca][]
- [How to write a plugin][]
- [Understanding data entities][]
- [Understanding query syntax][]
- [Understanding prior actions][]
- [Seneca with promises][]

## Books

These books help you understand how to design, build and deploy
microservice systems. Some of them cover Seneca directly, and others
provide more general guidance.

- [Microservice Books](/microservice-books.html)


## Sample projects
Sample projects are awesome. At Seneca, we have a good chunk of them available to study and extend. Seneca examples contains
multiple small, singularly focused sample projects. Both _Well!_ and _nodezoo_ are examples of larger-scale projects which are
closer to production ready apps than trivial examples.

### Seneca examples
For convenience, we have a number of sample apps in a single repository. This repository covers single concepts
as well as popular plugins. See the repo at [Seneca examples][].

### Well!
Well! is a simple networking game implemented as a mobile web app. Its purpose is to serve as an example of a real app, built with Node.js, Sencha Touch, and Seneca. See the repo at [Well!][].

### nodezoo
nodezoo is a search engine for Node.js modules. The nodezoo search engine is an example of a real-world service built using Node.js microservices. Each microservice is published in its own GitHub repository. The code base is intended to be used as a larger-scale example and as a starting point for your own projects. See the repo at [nodezoo][].
