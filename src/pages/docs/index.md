# Documentation

## Tutorials
Seneca tutorials offer a deep dive into a particular concept or feature. We also have a number
of sample projects, small and large that demonstrate how to use Seneca in a number of different
ways and with different complimentary technologies.

- [Logging with Seneca][Tutorial01]
- [How to write a plugin][Tutorial02]
- [Unit testing][unit-testing]
- [Understanding data entities][Tutorial03]
- [Understanding query syntax][Tutorial04]
- [Understanding prior actions][Tutorial05]
- [Seneca with promises][Tutorial06]

## Sample projects
For convenience, we have a number of sample apps in a single repository. This repository
covers single concepts as well as popular plugins. See the repo at [Seneca examples][Sample02].

### NodeZoo
NodeZoo is a search engine for Node.js modules. The complete system is an example of a real-
world service built using Node.js microservices. Each microservice is published in its
own GitHub repository. The code base is intended to be used as a larger-scale example and as a
starting point for your own projects. See the system at [NodeZoo][Sample02].

## Articles

- [Seneca 1.0.0: A microservices framework for Node.js][Article01]
- [Monolithic Node.js][Article02]

## Talks
Here are some talks about Seneca and Microservices:

- [We are not Object-Oriented anymore][Talk01] - _Matteo Collina (FullStack London 2015)_
- [Measuring Microservices][Talk02] - _Richard Rodger (microxchg.io Berlin 2015)_
- [Microservices][Talk03] - _Richard Rodger (NodeConf EU 2014)_

## Books
These books help you understand how to design, build and deploy microservice systems. Some
of them cover Seneca directly, and others provide more general guidance. The ideas in the
books listed here can be applied using Seneca without restriction. They all contain useful
insights, and more importantly, real-world lessons.

### The Tao of Microservices
The Tao of Microservices teaches you the path to understanding how to apply microservices
architecture with your own real-world projects. This high-level book offers you a conceptual
view of microservice architectures, along with core concepts and their application. You'll
also find a detailed case study for the nodezoo.com system, including all source code and
documentation. By the end of the book, you'll have explored in depth the key ideas of the
microservice architecture and will be able to design, analyze and implement systems based
on this architecture.

### Building Microservices
Distributed systems have become more fine-grained in the past 10 years, shifting from code-
heavy monolithic applications to smaller, self-contained microservices. But developing these
systems brings its own set of headaches. With lots of examples and practical advice, this book
takes a holistic view of the topics that system architects and administrators must consider
when building, managing, and evolving microservice architectures.

[Building Microservices][Book02]

### Antifragile Software
We've spent over a decade now becoming more and more agile and adaptable in our ways of
working. Unfortunately our software is now struggling to keep up with the pace of innovation
that is increasingly being demanded by modern businesses. It's time to sort that out. It's
time for Antifragile Software with Microservices.

[Antifragile Software][Book03]

### Microservices: Flexible Software Architectures
A Microservice-based architecture divides software systems into many small services which can
be deployed independently. Every team works on its own Microservices and is thus decoupled
from other teams. This allows to easily scale agile processes. The modularization into
Microservices protects the system against architecture decay. Consequently, systems based on
Microservices stay maintainable in the long term. In addition, legacy systems can be migrated
to Microservices without having to change the legacy code. Moreover, Continuous Delivery is
easier to implement in Microservice-based systems.

[Microservices: Flexible Software Architectures][Book04]

### Microservices in .NET
Microservices in .NET shows you how to build and deploy secure and operations-friendly
microservices using Nancy. The book takes you through an introduction to the microservices
architectural style. Next, you'll learn important practical aspects of developing microservices
from simple core concepts to more sophisticated. Throughout the book, you'll see many code
examples implementing it with lightweight .NET technologies - most prominently Nancy. By the
end, you'll be able to quickly and easily build reliable and operations-friendly microservices
using Nancy, OWIN and other open technologies.

[Microservices in .NET][Book05]


### Microservices in GO
GO is a great language for building microservices. However there are a lot of challenges to
navigate. How do you do caching, manage databases. Monitor and analyze performance. Integrate
with Docker. Do continuous deployments. Run on private or public clouds.

[Microservices in GO][Book06]


### SOA Patterns
SOA Patterns provides architectural guidance through patterns and anti-patterns. It shows you
how to build real SOA services that feature flexibility, availability, and scalability.
Through an extensive set of patterns, this book identifies the major SOA pressure points and
provides reusable techniques to address them. Each pattern pairs the classic problem/solution
format with a unique technology map, showing where specific solutions fit into the general
pattern.
